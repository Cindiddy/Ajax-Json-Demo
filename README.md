# Ajax-Json-Demo
In the previous brand-demo project, I used JSP to dynamically generate web pages.<br>
he JSP tags produce java code that generates a response.<br>
In this demo, I use ajax + json to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and the behavior of the existing page.
